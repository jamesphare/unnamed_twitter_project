# Unnamed Twitter Project

This repository is an open-ended exploration of my personal Twitter data. It's mainly an opportunity for me to practice using the Twitter API and text-mining.  

The exploration can be found in [Twitter-Exploration.md](https://github.com/jamesphare/unnamed_twitter_project/blob/master/Twitter-Exploration.md). The raw data is in the [data](https://github.com/jamesphare/unnamed_twitter_project/tree/master/data) folder.
